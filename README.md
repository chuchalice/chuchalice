## Currently i'm working on a couple of React apps.

### Some of my works: 
<ul>
<li><a href = 'https://chuchalice.github.io/API-github/'>GitHub repository search</a> (React app)</li>
<li><a href = 'https://chuchalice.github.io/guessMyNumber/'>Guess my Number</a> (goofy ahh game, it was done as part of a js course)</li>
<li><a href = 'https://chuchalice.github.io/kata_case_webcore/'>Online service</a> (did it from scratch by myself)</li> 
</ul>

## More projects soon
